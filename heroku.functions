	# We live in /app
	# The PATH defaults to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
	# /app contains our git repo, essentially, but less .git
	# /usr/local/bin is empty but owned by root so we can't install to it
	# We also have a .profile.d folder we can put scripts in, apparently
	# Our file system is writable (but transient)


	# We can run apt-get -d install, etc, and put them in our cache folder
	# But deb packages aren't designed to be relocatable, we'd need to chroot, for which we need to be root...
	# Other options:-
	#  Rootless GoboLinux  http://www.gobolinux.org/?page=rootless
	#  ArchLinux JuNest https://github.com/fsquillace/junest
	#  Install fakechroot manually?
	#  klik http://klik.atekon.de/ (Dead)
	#  AppImageKit  https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit
	#  apt-get source / dpkg -X (just does an extract)  https://serverfault.com/questions/23734/is-there-any-way-to-get-apt-to-install-packages-to-my-home-directory

	# Also examine
	# https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-multi (combine buildpacks)
	# https://github.com/peterkeen/heroku-buildpack-vendorbinaries (install from tarballs)
	# https://github.com/docverter/docverter

	# Personally, I'd like to move to a design where the heroku stuff is in a 'heroku' folder, but that requires a variant of the inline buildpack that doesn't look in 'bin'

	# I'd also like to be able to run the heroku toolbelt on heroku itself, or at least do basic deployment using shell script and not ruby + java

	# heroku run bash
